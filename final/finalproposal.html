        <h1>Final Proposal for CS140</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <h3>1. Title and Topic</h3>
            <p><strong>Title:</strong> Kusina Perez</p>
            <p><strong>Topic:</strong> The website that I will be making focuses on sharing my favorite traditional Filipino recipes that we usually cook in our own home, along with the stories and history behind each dish.</p>
        <h3>2. Why I chose this topic</h3>
            <p>In our family, one of the ways we bond together is through food. Our Dad cooks the best Filipino food and this would be a great way to preserve his recipes and precious memories we share as a family.</p>
