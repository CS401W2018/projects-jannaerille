        <h3>Engagement Questions:</h3>
        <h4>1. How much time should you spend on an engagement assignment after class? </h4>
        <p>You don't have to spend too much time on it, what's important is that you show that you understand the lesson and show that you tried out writing the program on your own.</p>
        <h4>2. What should you focus on?</h4>
        <p>Focus on answering the engagement questions and trying your best to follow along the discussion in class.</p>
        <h4>3. What is the main difference between CSS Grid and CSS Flex?</h4>
        <p>A CSS Grid is like a table with columns and rows. Flex offers more flexibility by allowing elements to be moved around on the page as needed.</p>
