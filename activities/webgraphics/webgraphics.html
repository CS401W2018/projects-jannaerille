    <h2>Engagement Questions: </h2>
    <h4>What kind of photos are good to encode using JPEG?</h4>
    <p>JPEG is best used for photographs and complex images with many colors and gradients, such as landscapes or portraits.</p>
    <h4>What kind of photos are good to encode using GIF?</h4>
    <p>GIF is ideal for simple images with few colors, like logos, icons, and simple animations.</p>
    <h4>What is unique about the PNG format?</h4>
    <p>Unlike JPEG, PNG does not lose image quality when compressed. It's great for images that require crisp edges and transparency, like logos or graphics with text.</p>
    <h4>How do you resize your photo to the size it should be displayed?</h4>
    <p>Use photo editing software like Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, or online tools to resize the image to the exact dimensions needed for display. This involves changing the image's pixel dimensions while maintaining the aspect ratio.</p>
    <h4>Why should you resize photos using photo editing software instead of resizing it using CSS?</h4>
    <p>If you don't shrink your images, the browser will load the whole picture and it will take more time.</p>
