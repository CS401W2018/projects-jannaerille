        <h2>Engagement Questions:</h2>
        <h3>1. What are the positives and negatives of hosting your videos on YouTube?</h3>
        <p>Hosting your videos on YouTube offers several benefits, including free hosting and bandwidth, global reach, ease of uploading and embedding, and advanced analytics. However, it also has drawbacks such as redirecting traffic away from your website, reduced control over branding, exposure to negative comments, clutter and distractions, limited ad revenue, and the risk of video removal due to YouTube's guidelines. Additionally, YouTube's open environment can undermine the professionalism of your brand and impact your website's SEO.</p>
        <h3>2. What is the most useful thing you can do with a transform?</h3>
        <p>In HTML and CSS, the transform property is highly useful for applying various visual effects to elements on a web page. You can use it to scale, rotate, translate, or skew elements, as well as create 3D-like effects. This allows you to enhance user experience, create interactive elements, and add dynamic visual effects such as animating buttons or designing complex layouts.</p>
        <h3>3. How do you stay safe online?</h3>
        <p>To stay safe online, protect your personal information and use strong, unique passwords for each account. Be cautious of strangers and phishing attempts, and avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading unknown files. Keep your devices and software updated with the latest security patches, and use secure networks or a VPN when necessary. Monitoring your online activities and closing unused accounts can also help prevent cyber threats.</p>
        <h3>4. What is the schedule for the rest of the class?</h3>
        <p>On Wednesday and Monday, we will be having a practice final exam. Our final exam is on Monday, December 9.</p>
