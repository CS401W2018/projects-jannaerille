    <h2>Internet</h2>
    <p>The <em>Internet</em> refers to a network of interconnected computers all around the globe. This allows them to share information with one another.</p>
    <h2>Web</h2>
    <p>The <em>Web</em> is a part of the Internet where websites and web pages can be found. It is a system of linked multimedia contents and hypertext documents that can be accessed through web browsers in the Internet. </p>
    <h2>How are the Internet and Web different?</h2>
    <p>The internet pertains to the whole global network of interconnected computers, while the Web merely refers to the service that works over the Internet that gives its users the ability to access and share media through websites. </p>
    <h2>ASCII and Unicode</h2>
    <p><em>ASCII</em> stands for the American Standard Code for Information Interchange. It is a standard for encoding characters that uses numeric codes to represent mainly English characters.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, <em>Unicode</em> is another standard for character encoding that could represent a broader set of characters from various languages and scripts, making it more versatile than ASCII.</p>
    <h2>What is UTF-8?</h2>
    <p><em>UTF-8</em>, also known as the 8-bit Unicode Transformation Format, is a way to encode text that can handle every character in the Unicode character set.</p>
    <h2>URL</h2>
    <p>The <em>Uniform Resource Locator (URL)</em> refers to the address used to acces resources on the Web. It is the one you type into the web browser to access a specific page or file.</p>
    <h2>Domain Name</h2>
    <p>The easy-to-remember name for a website's address is called the <em>Domain Name.</em> It usuall ends with a '.com' or '.org'</p>
    <h2>HTTP</h2>
    <p>The <em>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</em> is a set of rules used for transferring web pages on the Internet.</p>
    <h2>HTTPS</h2>
    <p>The <em>Hyptertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)</em> is a secure version of HTTP that encrypts the data being transferred across the Web.</p>
    <h2>IP Address</h2>
    <p><em>IP Address or Internet Protocol Address</em> is a unique numeric address that is used to identify each device or computer connected to the Internet.</p>
    <h2>DNS</h2>
    <p>The <em>Domain Name System (DNS)</em> is a system that matches domain names to IP Addresses.</p>
    <h2>W3C Recommendations</h2>
    <p>These are official rules and standards set by the <em>Word Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</em> to ensure that the Web works uniformly across different systems.</p>
    <h2>XML, XHTML, HTML, HTML5</h2>
    <p>The <em>eXtensible Markup Language (XML)</em> uses the tags that you define as a way to format and organize data.</p>
    <p>The <em>eXtensible Hyptertext Markup Language (XHTML)</em> is a stricter version of HTML that follows the rules of XML to ensure better structure and compatability.</p>
    <p><em>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</em> is the standard language used to create and design web pages. Its latest version is known as <em>HTML5</em> which introduces new tools and features for better web development and multimedia support.</p>
