        <h3>Engagement Questions:</h3>
        <h4>1. What is the difference between block tags and inline tags.</h4>
        <p>Block tags, like "div" and "p", start on a new line and take up the full width of their container. Inline tags, such as "span" and "a", stay in line with text and only use the space they need.</p>
        <h4>2. What is the margin, border, and padding?</h4>
        <p>Margin is the space outside an element, border is the line around it, and padding is the space between the border and the content. These help control how elements are spaced and displayed on a page.</p>
        <h4>3. What are units of measurement you can use in CSS?</h4>
        <p>You can use pixels (px), percentage (%), (Em) and (rem) for font sizes, and viewport units (vw, vh) for responsive design.</p>
        <h4>4. When would you use a figure tag?</h4>
        The figure tag is used for content that can stand alone, like images or charts, often with a caption. It helps organize your HTML better and makes it more accessible. For example, you can use it to wrap an image with a description below it.
