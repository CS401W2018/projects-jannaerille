        <p>One of my favorite favorite musical/theatrical actors is of course, the Philippines' very own, <strong>Lea Salonga</strong>. I just love her because of her extraordinary talent and groundbreaking achievements in theater. Her powerful voice, perfect pitch, and captivating performances have earned her numerous accolades, including Tony and Olivier Awards. As the first Asian woman to win a Tony and to play iconic roles like Eponine and Fantine in Les Miserables on Broadway, she has been a trailblazer for Asian representation in musical theater.</p>
        <p>Here's a list of some notable plays that Lea Salonga has performed in and the characters she portrayed:</p>
