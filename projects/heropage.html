            <p><span class="emphasis">One of my favorite musical/theatrical actors is of course, the Philippines' very own, Lea Salonga.</span> I just love her because of her extraordinary talent and groundbreaking achievements in theater. Her powerful voice, perfect pitch, and captivating performances have earned her numerous accolades, including Tony and Olivier Awards. As the first Asian woman to win a Tony and to play iconic roles like Eponine and Fantine in Les Miserables on Broadway, <span class="highlight">she has been a trailblazer for Asian representation in musical theater.</span></p>
