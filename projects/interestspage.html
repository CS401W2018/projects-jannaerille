        <p>Not everyone likes musicals, but I absolutely do! I believe my first exposure to musicals was when I was about 5 years old-- I watched High School Musical by Disney for the very first time. They just have this incredible way of telling stories that just pulls me in. When characters break into song, it's like they're sharing their deepest feelings, making the emotions feel so much more intense. Whether it's a heart-wrenching ballad or a fun, upbeat number, I find myself singing along and getting lost in their journeys. It's such a unique experience that really connects me to the characters.</p>
        <p>Another reason why I'm a huge fan of musicals is the thrill of seeing them live. There's something special about being in atheater, surrounded by others who are just as excited. Watching talented performers sing and dance right in front of me is incredible! Each performance feels fresh and different, with amazing costumes and choreography that always leaves me in awe. Musicals truly brighten my day and inspire me!</p>
