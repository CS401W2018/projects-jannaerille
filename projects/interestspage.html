            <p><span class="emphasis">Not everyone likes musicals, but I absolutely do!</span> I believe my first exposure to musicals was when I was about 5 years old-- I watched High School Musical by Disney for the very first time. They just have this incredible way of telling stories that just pulls me in. When characters break into song, it's like they're sharing their deepest feelings, making the emotions feel so much more intense. Whether it's a heart-wrenching ballad or a fun, upbeat number, I find myself singing along and getting lost in their journeys. It's such a unique experience that really connects me to the characters.</p>
            <p>Another reason why I'm a huge fan of musicals is the thrill of seeing them live. There's something special about being in a theater, surrounded by others who are just as excited. Watching talented performers sing and dance right in front of me is incredible! Each performance feels fresh and different, with amazing costumes and choreography that always leaves me in awe. <span class="highlight">Musicals truly brighten my day and inspire me!</span></p>
            <h2>About Links...</h2>
            <p>A <strong>relative link</strong> is a type of hyperlink that leads to a resource within the same website without including the full URL. On the other hand, an <strong>absolute link</strong> provides the complete URL, including the protocol (like HTTP or HTTPS), domain name, and path to the resource. This type of link specifies the exact location of a resource on the internet, making sure that it works regardless of where it is used.</p>
