    <p><em>Mabuhay, mga kaibigan!</em> My name is <mark>Ellah</mark> and I'm from the beautiful Pearl of the Orient Seas, the Philippines! I was born in the island of Cebu in the year 2001. I belong to a family of six and I am actually the third child of four, which means that I have two older sisters and one younger brother. Growing up, my family spent a lot of time together going on roadtrips, eating out, singing karaoke, and playing card games. Speaking of card games, the following are my favorite to play:</p>

        <li>Uno</li>
        <li>Phase 10</li>
        <li>Swoop</li>
        <li>Monopoly GO</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Last January, I made a huge decision to come to Hawaii and study here at BYU-H. So far, I would say that it was a very good decision for me to do so. I am currently studying Computer Science as my major, with Entrepreneurship &amp; Foundational Language Studies as my minors. I am definitely enjoying my time here in Hawaii, studying, working as a tour guide in the PCC and visiting beautiful places with my friends. But of course, my life isn't perfect. Whenever it gets really hard, I always remember this quote:</p>
    <blockquote>"When life gets too hard to stand, <strong>kneel</strong>."</blockquote>
